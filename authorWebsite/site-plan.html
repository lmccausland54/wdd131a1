			<h3>Visit the Worlds</h3>
			<p> Legion of Saints </p>
            <p>
                In a world shrouded in night, where the clash between divine light and demonic darkness rages on, 
                the cleric-soldiers known as the Legion of Saints stand as the last bastion of hope. Led by the enigmatic Master Theologians, 
                they wield the powers of their divine Mother God, Heia, in a desperate struggle against the malevolent Curators and demons summoned from the Inferno.
            </p>
            <p>
                Octavia, Artemis, Ezra, Edith, and Jude fight as a unified team, each blessed with unique powers by Mother Heia to be used in conjunction with each other. 
                Each is burdened by secrets, scars of the past, and fears for the future, that they must overcome as the Curator’s 
                set a plan into motion to plunge their world into war once again.

            <p>From Above and Beneath</p>
            <p>In a world ravaged by nuclear wars and overrun by blood-thirsty mutants known as Vermin, Iveanne Orlan, masquerading as Nyco, flees the opulent but venomous world of Zenith. 
                As heir to the powerful House Orlan, her destiny is predetermined, a mere pawn in a game of more powerful players. 
                But Nyco seeks refuge in the Sentinel Division of the Nexar military, bonded and neurologically linked to Alias, a cybernetically enhanced human weapon called a Nighthawk. 
                Sentinels and Nighthawks, two sides of the same coin, but a world apart.

            </p>
            <p>
                As Nyco delves deeper into the mysteries of her past and the truth behind her existence, she finds herself entangled in a dangerous game of secrets, betrayal, and forbidden love. 
                With the lines between friend and foe blurred, Nyco and Alias must navigate the treacherous waters of their own hearts while facing battles on two fronts: 
                the looming threat of Vermin attacks, and the political poison seeping into the foundation of their floating city, the last bastion of civilization. 
                It’s not only their lives at stake, but the lives of all those they hold dear. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As loyalties are tested, alliances crumble, pieces are moved into play, and Nyco and Alias find themselves in a war much bigger than they ever imagined. 
                “From Above and Beneath” is a gripping tale of survival, love, and rebellion set against the backdrop of a technologically-advanced dystopian world that asks the question:
                 what is the worth of a soul?
